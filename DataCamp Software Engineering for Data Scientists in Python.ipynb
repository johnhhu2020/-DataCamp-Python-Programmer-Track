    "**Welcome to the course \"Software Engineering for Data Scientists in Python\".  My name is Adam Spannbauer.  I'm a Data Scientist from Tennessee who likes to code in both R and Python.  \n",

    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "In this course, we'll be covering aoftware engineering concepts that can revolutioniza your Data Science workflow.  SO why should a Data Scientistcare about the principles of Software Engineering?  Many Data Scientists, like myself, start in the world of math & statistics.  And soon after, you learn that communicating these technical ideals is just as important as understanding them yourself.  However, many Data Scientists are self-taught programmers who see coding as a means to an end; its just a step to create a model or run a simulation.  But in reality, SOftware Engineering is a valuable skill that needs to be learned and practiced.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will help you buildyour software engineering skills by introducing some very important concepts.  Three topics in particular that we'll coverare Modularity, Documentation, and Testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another topic worth mentioning is Version Control.  We won't be covering it in this course, but I recommend checking out the related DataCamp course to learn more about this powerful tool.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets define each of these comcepts that we'll be covering.  First was Modularity.  To introduce modular code lets start by defining what its not.  Non-modular code can take the form of long, complicated, hard to read script and functions.  Programming becomes less complex when your code is divided into shorter functional units, and this is the whole idea behind modularity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With modular code, not only does code become more readable but it becomes easier to fix when something breaks.  Additionally, modular code is easier to take along with you to your next project; which allows you to save time by avoiding re-solving problems you've already solved in a previous project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write modular code in Python by leveraging packages, classes, and mothods.  In below example code, we import Pandas package.  We create a new object using the powerful DataFramme class from Pandas.  Finally, we use the convenient plot method that comes built into the DataFrame class.  Later in this course, you'll write a fully functional Python package using all these concepts to perform text analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work on a team or if you ever publish a project, then other people will need to read your code, and sometimes, the other person is just future you.  Both future you and other people will have an easier time reading your project if you use a good documentation practices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll cover how to use \"comments\", \"docstrings\", and \"self-documenting code\" to document your Data Science Python projects.  A project using all these techniques can save a lot of confusion and frustration for everyone who touches the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last Software Engineering concept we'll touch on is Testing.  One thing everyone learns is that people make mistakes.  That's why pencils have erasers, why computers have spellcheck, and why software needs tests.  Often times Data Scientists will write some code, test it in the console once, and then never test it again.  Its definitely worthwhile to perform these manual texts, but leveraging tools like the \"pytest\" package can automatically run and re-run your tests to ensure your code is working as intended even after new functionality.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**You've now learned some important Software Engineering concepts.  We're now going to look at how beneficial these concepts can be as a user of Python open source software.  Namely, we're going to investigate packages.  We'll cover how to install packages from the Python Package Index, and we'll see how these packages leverage software engineering concepts we've covered.  Later in this course, we'll talk more about the Python Package Index, or PyPi for short, but for now, all you need to know is that PyPi gives us an easy platform to leverage published packages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to packages being modular, we can easily install them from PyPi using a tool called \"pip\".  The \"pip\" is actually a recrusive acronym that stands for Pip Installs Packages, and it does just that.  The practice of leveraging pip install can save a lot of time and lets us aviod reworking problems that have already been solved and packaged by some smart membersof the Python community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to install the popular package NumPy we conveniently use the command \"pip install numpy\".  Barring any unexpected issues we now have NumPy installed and we can leverage all the benefitsthat come with this powerful package.  Note that pip will also install a package's dependencies as long as they're on PyPi.  However, in some cases, a package's dependencies might require a little extra work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we leverage NumPy's features?  Again thanks to good software engineering, NumPy has excellent documentation available both on the web and in the package itself.  Here we'll focus on the documentation shipped with the package.  Lets say we want to count the number of work days of in the year 2020.  NumPy provides the function \"np.busday_count()\" that can help us accomplish this, but how do we use it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "To view a function's documentation we can use the function \"help()\".  Below is the syntax we can use to learn more about NumPy's \".busday_count()\" method.  And we can see the response to our call for help.  Note that the output has been truncated in the slides.  From this documentation, we see  description of the function, its parameters, and how we can expect as output.  Additionally, we see an example that perfectly matchesour described use case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We just saw that we can use \"help()\" to see a methods documentation, but we can also call helpon any object in Python.  We can call \"help()\" on the NumPy package to see some high-level documentation on what functionality it provides.  And we can call \"help()\" on an integer, from the output, we can read up on Python's integer class.  As we can tell, having this documentation can be invaluable to users like you and me.  But sometimes you might call \"help()\" on an object and see that there isn't any documentation.  Its up to developer to include these helpful tidbits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Including documentation for your packages, classes and methods will make using your code much easier.  Its important to remember that future-you is also a user who will benefit from this documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Believe me, documenting your code, even if you're the only user, can save a lot of wasted time and headaches.  I've personally suffered through relearning how to use code that I wrote, but this is totally preventable with good documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We covered how to pip packages and how to read documentation using \"help()\".  \n",

    "**Great work on those exercises, In our short time together, we've seen how helpful the Python community can be.  Not only have they provided some excellent packages for us to use, but they've also provided documentation to help us use them.  Something you probably know from real life is that different cultures and communities follow different guildlines that can help them run smoothly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example this can be seen in different greetings, depending on which community setting you're in, it might make sense to say hwllo by shaking hands, bowing, or bumping fists.  These unwritten rules are knownas social conventions.  The world of Software Engineering also has conventions that differ based on the langurage and community.  Luckily for Pythonistas, these conventions are't unwritten.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can turn to Python Enhancement Protocol 8 or PEP 8.  PEP 8 is the defacto Style Guide for Python Code.  Lt lets us know how to formatour code to be as readable as possible, and to quote PEP 8, \"code is read much often that it is written\".  So readability is not something that should be overlooked.  Lets see an example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Herewe have some code that violates PEP 8 best practices.  To put it simply, the code here is hard to read.  A few problems are: The module import isn't at the top of the file, the spacing and indentation is inconsistent, and the lack of line breaks makes it difficult to tell when one idea finishes and the next one begins.  Even without knowing the specific PEP 8 rules being broken, you can probably tell this isn't the most readable chunk of code.  Lets see that same chunk of code looks like after being rewritten to conform to PEP 8.  Much better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By following the agreed-upon rulesin PEP 8 and using whitespace appropriately, this code become much more readable despite accomplishing the same exact task.  So how is it possible to keep up with the many rules defined in PEP 8?  Thankfully for you and me, there are tools that can check your code for you just like a spellchecker.  \n",

One in particular that you'll be exposed to in this course is the \"pycodestyle\" package.  The \"pycodestyle\" can check code in multiple files at once and it outputs descriptions of the violations along with information to let you know exactly where you need to go to fix the issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some example code on how to install and use \"pycodestyle\" package from the shell.  As you'll see in the exercise later you can also run \"pycodestyle\" from a Python script.  Below I use the command line interface to check the contents of the file \"sample_pycodestyle.py\" that contains our poorly formatted code from before.  Note that the output we see on this slide has been truncated.  \n",

    "The output shows us the exact location of any violationsby showing the \"file name\", \"line number\", and \"column number\" where the problem occurred.  Note that the output does not use zero based indexing.  Additionally, pycodestyle output human readable description of the PEP 8 violationand an error code.  A complete list of pycodestyle's possible error codes can be seen in the packages documentation.  \n",

    "A minimal Python package consists of 2 elements: a directory and a Python file.  You can see the basic structure under your JupyterLab working environment.  The name of the directory will be the name of the package, but how should you name it?  We can turn to PEP 8 for some guildance.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "To paraphrase, PEP 8 states that packages should have short, all-lowercase names.  The use of underscores in a package name is discouraged, but you can and should use them if it improves readability.  Outside of this, you have freedom to brand as you'd like.  I'd suggest pisking a name that convers the functionality of the package.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "The file in our newly branded directory doesn't have any flexibility in naming.  We must name it \"__init__.py\".  This file lets Python know that the directory we created is a package.  And thats it.  With this structure we've created a package that we can import just like we would import NumPy or any other package.  \n",

    "Note that as of Python version 3.3, any directory can be imported as if it were a package without error even if it doesn't follow this structure.  Earlier versions of Python would throw an error if you tried to import an improperly formatted package.  Even though a directory might import without error, you will run into issues if you do not follow this structure.  \n",

We'll be working in the \"my_script.py\" file that's in the same location as our package directory.  With all the setup we've done so far, importing the package is a breeze.  At the top of our script, we can use import my_package.  Just for an added bonus, lets check out what happens if we try to call help on our package.  We get some minimal information with Python letting us know that it is indeed a package and additionally we see the location of our __init__.py file.  \n",

    "**Great work on those exercises.  You're now a bonafide Python developer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step to package development is to add some useful functionality.  To start, lets again look at the file structure we'll be using.  Here we've added a file to our package's directory named \"utils.py\".  Again, when we import and work with our resulting package we'll be in the \"my_script.py\" file thats in the same directory as our package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can choose a different name than \"utils.py\", but keep in mind that file names should follow the same conventionsas package naming.  That is file names should be all lower case and avoid underscores unless it improves readability or if its a special case such as our package's \"__init__.py\" file.  With the right structure in place, the next step is to write some code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Here, in our \"utils.py\" file, we write a function that prints one of two possible statements based on user input.  Our \"utils.py\" file is known as a submodule and we can import it with a dot notation syntax of the form: \n",
    "# package_name.submodule_name.function_name  (be careful here, check the instances in below code boxes)\n",
    "In this \"my_script.py\" example, we call \"my_packages.utils.we_need_talk\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use our package's \"__init__.py\" file to make our \"utils.py\" function more easily accessible by the user.  To do this, we import our function in our \"__init__.py\" file as you see below.  The dot notation we use when writing \".utils\" is known as a relative import and it must be used when packaging in Python 3 and above when working under \"work_dir/my_package/__init__.py\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Importing our function in the \"__init__.py\" file saves some typing when we want to import and use our function.  We're now able to call \"my_packages.we_need_talk.py\" without including the additional reference to our utils submodule, importing the function in the \"__init__.py\" file took care of this reference for us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we added a single file, or submodule, to our package, but we can extend this structure indefinitely to meet our needs.  However, when creating larger packages you must be more mindful about organization.  When working with multiple submodules should you import them all in \"__init__.py\"?  As a general rule, you should import your packages' key functionality in your \"__init__.py\" file to make it directly and easily accessible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Less central functionality can be accessed by user throughthe longer submodule dot syntax we saw earlier.  The decision of what is key functionality is a gray area, and because of this, there isn't always a clear best way to organize your package.  As a package developer, you'll need to use your judgement to decide what you think will give your users the best experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to adding additional submodules, you can also build out packages inside your package.  These are know as subpackages.  Notice how the subpackage still follows the packaging rules of being a directory with an \"__init__.py\" file.  We won't covering subpackages in depth in this course but exposure to these different structures can be helpful when lookig at someone else's code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, we just covered how to add functionality by defining functions in a package by using submodules and the \"\"__init__.py\" file.  In the following exercises, you'll practice this important skill.  \n",

    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# **Now that you have a functional package you might want to share it with your colleagues.  The two main steps to sharing a Python package are creating a \"setup.py\" and \"requirements.txt\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "These two pieces provide information on how to install your package and recreate its required environment.  These files list information about what dependancies you've used as well as allowing you to describe with additional metadata.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how two files fit into our package structure.  They're located at the same level as our package directory.  Now lets see what content goes into the files themselves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# A \"requirements.txt\" file shows how to recreate the environment needed to properly use your package.  \n",
    "This includes a list of Python packages and optionally the version requirements for each package.  Here we see 3 different ways to specify our requirements.  If we don't have a reason to specify a version we can just list the package name as you see here for Matplotlib.  If version is important.  We can mark a specific version by using a double equals, or mark a minimum version by using greater than or equal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since open source packages are constantly envolving, apecifying a version can be a big help to your users.  To leverage our requirements file we can use this \"pip install -r requirements.txt\" command.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "This installs all the packages listed with respect the correct version.  Note that we didn't actually install our package, we just recreated its environment.  The \"setup.py\" is what tells pip how to install our actual package.  Additionally, its info will be used by PyPi if you decide to publish.  The contents of this in our case contains a single call to the setup function from the setuptools package.  There are other options, but \"setuptools\" is one of the most commom and powerful choices.  Below we use just a few of the possible setup arguments.  There are many more options available that you can read more about in the \"setuptools\" documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "The argument's names make them fairly self-explanatory; for example, your packages' name is assigned to name and so on.  Some less obvious arguments in our example are \"install_requires\" and \"packages\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"packages\" in essence lists the location of all the \"__init__.py\" files in our package.  Our package has a single \"__init__.py\" file and its in the directory \"my_package\".  As we saw before, more complex packages might include subpackages with their own \"__init__.py\" files, if this was the case we would also list their location here.  Until you writing more complex packages, the contents of the packages list will likely be the same as the name argument.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"install_requires\" might look familiar, in the case of our package, the contents are the same as our requirements file.  An example of when \"install_requires\" can differ is if you want to specify where pip should download pacakge from.  This can be specified in the \"requirements.txt\" file as shown below.  We won't go into much detail here since this advanced option is not often needed in everyday use.  To read up more on the differences you can see the documentation by Google \"install_requires vs requirements files\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Now that we've completed our \"setup.py\", we can install our package with pip using \"pip install .\" from the inside the same directory as our package. ( Think Think \"pip install -r requirements.txt\" command )  This will install our package at an environment level so we can import it into any Python script using the same environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We just covered some important aspects of how to make your package portable.  \n",

    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "**So far you've been able to create a fully portable Python package, and you even added functionality to your package by utilizing functions.  We'll now look at how you can use classes to strengthen your packages's functionality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a great way to write modular code, and reap the benefits of modularity as easily understood and extensible code.  We'll cover some aspectof OOP, but if you want a deeper dive I recommend the dedicated DataCamp courses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets jump into some code.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "In Python, OOP can be utilized by writing classes.  Here we see a minimal class implementation.  To start we use the keyword class followed by the name of our class.  According to PEP 8, our class name should be written in camel case, that is, our class name should start with a capital letter and every word in the name should have a capital letter as well.  Unlike function and package names, class names should never contain underscores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, is some documentation that will appear when a user calls help on our class.  We'll cover the details of this particular documentation formatting later in the course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we see a function with a familiar name __init__().  Similarly to your package's \"__init__.py\" file, this will initialize everything when a user wants to leverage your class.  You might have noticed we use a variable named \"self\", we'll get back to this in a couple slides.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "To make our class easily accessible, we can add it to our \"__init__.py\" file just like we've done with functions before.  We use relative import syntax to import MyClass from the \"my_class.py\" file in the same directory, we can now import the package and access MyClass easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets create what's known as an instance of MyClass.  To do this, we call MyClass like a function and supply a string to the value parameter.  Calling our class like this tells Python that we want to create an instance of our class by using the init method.  Recall that MyClass's init method set the contents of value to a variable we referenced as \"self.attribute\".  Users can access this attribute by referencing \"my_instance.attribute\".  Note, nowhere in this script do we see the self-object what we used when defining our class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Lets look more in depth at the use of self in our class's init method.  \n",
    "# The \"self\" is, in essence, a way to refer to a class instance even though we don't know what the user is actually going to name their instance.  ( Then what about the self arg in def under class? an instance of that function ? )\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining typical class instance method, like __init__, self is the first argument.  However, if you recall creating an instance of MyClass, when using __init__, the user doesn't need to pass a value to this self argument; this is done automatically behind the scenses. Once in the method body, we can use self to access or define attributes.  The usercan then access these attributes by using their class instance's name in place of self, like we did in our script.  Technically we can use a different word than self, but this is a very strong PEP8 convention and not abiding by it will make your code very hard to read by your collaborators.  \n",

So where does \"_tokenize\"_ come from?  and why does it have an underscore in fron of it?  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Lets first answer the question of where the method came from.  Since this course isn't focused on teaching text analytics, we aren't going to cover the tokenization function implementation; we'll simply import a function to do it for us.  In a way, this demontrates the beauty of modularity and Python's community.  Often times there are functions already written by someone in the community, and all you need to do is find out where they are and import them for your own use cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "Moving on to the definition of \"_tokenize\"_.  We only pass one parameter to the function, the prescribed self convention that will represent an instance of the Document object.  Since the tokenize function is already written, all that's left to do is call it on the text attribute.  And viola.  (Think here)  To tokenization process will now be completed automatically as soon as a user creates a Document instance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "So why did we use a leading \"_ \" when naming \"_tokenize\"_?  The reason we added the tokenization process to the __init__ method is that we wanted tokenization to happen immediately without the user having to think about it.  Because of this, the user doesn't need to call \"_tokenize\"_ themselves; in other words, this method doesn't need to be \"public\" to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "According to PEP8, non-public methods should be named with a single underscore \"_ \".  This signifies to the user that the method is intended for internal use only.  Users can still use non-public methods in their own workflow, but they must do so at their own risk since the developer did not intend for them to do so.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The risks of using non-public method in your own workflow include: little or no documentation and function's input or output might change without warning when the develpoer updates their package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now seen how we can add more functionality to our Document class.  In the upcoming exercises, you'll add additional methods to streamline our text analytics workflow; you'll even write your first non-public method.  \n",

    "**Interesting work on the exercises, our package now has a handy Document class that can be used to analyze any generic text.  What if we wanted to specialize this functionality to focus on the social media data we've been analyzing?  To do this lets create a \"SocialMedia\" class that performs the same functions as the Document class, but can additionally analyze social media specific things like hashtags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# However, when making this \"SocialMedia\" class we want to preserve the \"Document\" class as is to be used for more general analysis.  SO how can we do this? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A first guess might be to copy-paste the contents of the Document class.  This violates what is know as the DRY principle in Software Engineering.  The DRY principle is a great rule that , if followed, can help you write modular, readable code.  DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to follow this rule such as writing re-usable functions, classes, and packages.  The benefits of staying DRY are not only saving time by reusing code, but also if you copy-paste code, and later find a bug, you have to remember everywhere you've pasted the buggy code and fix each instance individually.  If you stay DRY you only need to fix the bug once.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "In the case of extending the Document class to be a SocialMedia class,  we can stay DRY by using Object Oriented Programming concept of inheritance.  \n",
    "# With inheritance, we start with a parent class and we pass on its functionality to a child class.  The child class inherits all the methods and attributes of its parent, and we're able to add additional functionality without affecting the parent class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we leverage inheritance in Python?  To start lets see how the child SocialMedia class fits into the package structure.  It will live as a single file named after the SocialMedia class at the same level as the rest of the package's code.  Now lets see how to actually write a child class that uses inheritance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "You'll be writing the code for the SocialMedia class, so we'll stick to a generic example.  First, we import the ParentClass for use in defining our ChildClass.  To let Python know we're using inheritance, we pass the ParentClass as an argument in our class statement.  Last, we call our ParentClass's __init__ method.  Remember, __init__ builds an instance of a class and it also accepts self as its first argument.  With this call, we're building an instance of ParentClass and storing it right back into self.  This means that self now has all the metods and attributes that an instance of ParentClass would.  We can now use self as normal to build in additional functionality unique to ChildClass.  Below we just add an attribute.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With our definitions, we can now create an instance of our new ChildClass as we've seen before, and them access attribute from both the parent and the child.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using inheritance like this can lead to short, easy to read definitions of children classes that are just jam-packed with the functionality of their parents.  We've just covered the important concepts of DRY and class inheritance.  You'lll now use both of these concepts by building a custom SocialMedia class that extends the Document class you've already written.  \n",

    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "The SocialMedia class has some general functionality dealing with hashtags and mentions that works across multiple social media platforms.  If we want to include functionality about retweets, it wouldn't be appropriate to include in the general class: instead, we can create a Tweet class.  So how can we do this without losing the benefits of both the Document and SocialMedia classes?  With inheritance again of course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen before that a child class can inherit from a parent class.  We can continue the family tree again with inheritance.  With multilevel inheritance, our child is all grown up and can pass its functionality onto its children.  Thanks to inheritance we pass along the trace of all prior classes in the family tree.  Note, that in the graphic (slide) we only have one inheriting class at each level, but we are by no means limitd to this.  \n",
    "# Multiple classes can inherit from the same parent.  In fact, one child class can inherit from multiple parents. \n",
    "This more advanced OOP concept is known as \"Multiple Inheritance\".  We won't covering it in this course, but its good to familiarize yourself with the definition in case you hear of it out in the wild.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets code up an example of multilevel inheritance.  We'll start with inheritance pattern we've seen before.  Below we define a Parent and Child class that inherits from the Parent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# We could do this differently, by using the \"super()\" function.  Instead of directly calling the __init__ method of Parent we use the \"super()\" function.  This makes no functional difference in our code here but it has some advantages in maintainability and when implementing multiple inheritance.  \n",
    "However, there are some 'gotchas' that can arise with super and multiple inheritance; you can check out this companion DataCamp tutorial to learn more about it.  (Google \"Learn more about multiple inheritance & super()\")\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets continue the family tree, to create a Grandchild class that inherits from SuperChild we use the same super syntax in its __init__ method, and viola.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using inheritance its sometimes hard to remember what attributes annnd methods your class has at the end of it all.  If you're using an IDE, then generally you can use tab complete to get a list of suggestions.  However, if you want to get the info from the console, you can use either \"help\" or the \"dir\" function.  The \"help\" is a good option in most cases, but it will onnly include public methods in its output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using \"dir\" will print a fairly exhaustive list of what your class has under the covers.  The list includes methods that come with our class object by default.  Near the end of the list, you see all the methods and attributes that you personaly programmed into the SocialMedia class.  The \"dir\" can definitely come in handy, but a warning from the documentation, \"dir is supplied primarily as a convenience of use at an interactive prompt\"  SO its not advised to use it in your scripts.  \n",

    "**One of the big Software Engineering concepts that all Python users benefit from is Documentation.  Documentation in Python can take the form of comments.  Comments in Python are led by the pound symbol as you see here.  They can sprinkle in information about your code for future collaborators.  Another way of documenting code is to use docstrings.  Docstrings are invoked by the use of triple quotation marks like you see before in Python OOP course.  They are typically used to document functions classes, and scripts for your users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Lets look at both these in a little more detail.  \n",
    "Comments are used inline to document what a particular line of code is doing and why.  They can appear on their own line or at the end of a line of code.  A big difference between docstrings and comments is that comments will not be seen by your users unless they are looking into your source code.  The goal of comments is to make your code more readable for both yourself and collaborators.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is some debateon the usefulness of comments.  Take a moment to look at these comments.  As you can see they don't ass much value: unless the code is trying to teach someone about Python basics, then these could be useful comments.  So its important to know your audience when commenting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# However, a good rule is that comments should explain why a line od code is doing something and not what the line of code is doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the same code with different comments to explain the why of the code.  In my opinion, over-commented code isn't nearly as big of a headache as under-commented code.  \n",
    "# If you ever have question of wheather or not a comment is useful, I would suggest adding the comment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comments are documentation for yourself and collaborators, docstrings are documentation for your users.  \n",
    "Docstrings are what Python outputs wheather a user calls help on your functions and classes.  Lets look at the anatomy of a docstring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "The first section describe the functionality of what we're documenting.  Next, we document the parametersand return value of our function.  We use this particular syntax with the colons by convention so that downstream tools can take our docstrings and convert them into website based documentation.  You can see an example of a webpage generated from a docstring formatted like ours, at below link which shows the documentation for the popular Flask package.  (Google Example webpage generated from a docstringin the Flask package).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we can document example usage and expected output.  The 3 chevrons show the example function call and the next line will represent the expected output.  Here we see a docstring actually filled out to describe a function and its usage.  It contains a brief description, information on the parameter & return values, and an example showing how the function is used.  In the case of this simple function, the optional details section wouldn't add much value so its been omitted.  In addition to the docstring, we see comments explaining why the code was written a certain way, as opposed to what the code is doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've written the docstring for the square function, users can access it by calling help.  When they do they'll see this print out showing all the information they'd need to understand what it does and use it properly.  Note, as mentioned before, the users don't see our comments that describe our implementation details to future colaborators.  \n",

    "**Another important step to writing a maintainable project is readable code.  Luckily, Python has a big focus on readability, and it comes with a list of guidelines to help write good code.  These guidelines are known as the \"Zen of Python\", and you can view them through the command \"import this\".  Here we see a abridged version in the slide.  Notice the item , \"readability counts\", and the rest of the items can guide us in this quest for readability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# One way to aid in readability is with good naming.  \n",
    "Look at below two functions.  Both implement the same logic.  However, if we believe \"readability counts\", then the 'is_boiling' function is a better option.  The 'is_boiling' function describes what it's doing thanks to descriptive naming.  This is known as self-documenting code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, remember that under-commented is a bigger issue than over-commented code; if you're ever in doubt, add comments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A warning about descriptive names.  It's possible to go too far.  Modern IDEs have auto-complete so it might not seen like a burden to type long names, but long names can  make code hard to read, as you see here.  Note, even if your code is self-documenting, your users will appreciate the ability to call help and see all the good information a docstring can provide.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# Another way to keep your project readable is by writing in simple maintainable units of code.  \n",

    "Lets take a look at an example by writing a function to make a pizza.  Take a look at this code to make a pizza.  Notice that the full definition doesn't fit on the slide.  Although we're working with a small screen, not being able to fit your function on the screen is a sign that it maybe should be refactored.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A less obvious issue is that we have a few different processes happening that could stand on their own.  We're making dough and then making a sauce; we might want to be able to make dough outside of the pizza process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets do some refactoring.  Take a second to look at this refactored function.  Its easier to see what's happening, in both a functional sense and a literal one since we were ablt to fully fit it on the screen.  By breaking process out into their own descriptively named functions we can see the high-level process of making a pizza at a glance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An additional benefit of defining these smaller functions is that we now have more modular code that we can easily plug into different recipes that might call for our homemade marinara.  These also make writing tests easier, which we'll soon be covering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "You should atrive for your functions to accomplish one and only one thing.  In our pizza example, we were using comments as section headers to denote different processes; if you're ever doing that then its a good bet that your code should be split into smaller functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another warning sign that your function is doing too much is if its hard to think of a good meaningful name for it. \n",

    "**Even well-documented, readable code isn't very useful if doesn't work correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where testing can come in handy.  With testing, you can fonfirm your code is working as intended.  You probably run some manual tests.  Instead of writing these tests in the console, you could add much more value to your project by adding these test suite.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A written test can be re-run after you make changes to check if there were any unexpected effects.  Also, changes in dependencies can sometimes break your code.  Automated tests can alert you problems like this and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# So how do we test in Python?\n",
    "We'll cover 2 easy to use options: \"doctest\" & \"pytest\".  Thanks to writing informative docstrings with examples included, you've already written tests that can be run with doctest.  Lets look at an example with this square function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To use doctest we need to import it and run the testmod command to test our module's examples.  When we run the test we see that it failed.  ( did not use round to make return value to int ).  Looks like there was a typo in the docstring example that was caught thanks to doctest.  If there were no failed tests the output testmod would be blank.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The \"doctest\" are great for smaller examples, but you often can't cover every case you want to test in a docstring.  \n",
    "For example, if your function returns a large Pandas DF this could be hard to include as a doctest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# For larger cases, there is pytest.  \n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "To use pytest, I recommend a tests directory at the same level as your package's directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to pytest's flexibility, there are other options.  For example, if developing a larger package it might be useful to break out subpackage tests into their own folders.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets write some tests for our Document class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# First, notice the \"test_\" prefix.  The \"pytest\" searches for tests by first looking for files that startor end with the word test, and then pytest runs all the functions in these files who's name follow the same pattern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within our test method, we've then created an instance of document as our test case.  Last, we run the actual test with the assert keyword.  As long as the assertion is True, our test passes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When testing, its also a good idea to test for the edge cases that you can think of.  For example, here we could test the expected attributes of a blank Document.  Note that when testing class objects, its not wise to compare two objects with double equals.  Here we create two identical Document objects and test equality.  Our test shows the objects are not the same.  Instead, to compare objects we can compare attributes as we seen here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# To run our test we head to the terminal in oour work_dir directory, run the command \"pytest\" and wait for our output.  Jus that simple.  \n",
    "We see that all our tests passed and our code is running as expected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# *******************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "# If we just wanted to run the tests in one file, our command might look like this and we'd only get the results for that file's tests.  Powerful right? \n",
    "\n",
    "So far all of our tests have passed.  Lets look at some out put when things go wrong.  In the output, we see exactly  which test failed and even how it failed.  This information can be a lifesaver when your projects grow and tracking down bugs becomes a more time-consuming process.  \n",
